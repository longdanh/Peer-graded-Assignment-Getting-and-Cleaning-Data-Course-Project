## Getting and Cleaning Data, Peer Asses

# Download data from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and save data to your working directory

# In Rstudio, install and running R package "reshape2"

# Running run_analysis.R script

## Cleaning steps of run_analys.R script :

# Step 1 : Reading and extract only feature data of mean or standard deviation (required data)

# Step 2 : Read and subset required data for training and test feature data then combine them into 1 dataset and then label it

# Step 3 : Read and combine the training and test activity codes

# Step 4 : Read activity label data and bind to  activity code

# Step 5 : Read and combine training and test subject and then, merge and label subject and activity

# Step 6 : Combine dataset of step 2 and step 5 to get completed dataset

# Final step : Calculate result, create independent tidy data set call "new_data.txt", report mean of all measurement
